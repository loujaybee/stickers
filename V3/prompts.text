Context: These prompts are for generating sticker designs for an AI engineering conference. Each sticker should be a unique combination of copy, style, and color palette while maintaining a cohesive tech-meets-fun theme.

IMPORTANT: The sticker copy/text below is FINAL and must NEVER be modified, reworded, or changed in any way. Only the visual styling should be iterated on.

Sticker Copy (Core Messages):
1. "Unlocking vibe coding at enterprises"
2. "Vibe code with Cursor at work"

Design Requirements:
- Each sticker should maintain readability at both large and small sizes
- Text must dynamically determine background shape size (no fixed circles/squares)
- Background shapes should "hug" text content with consistent padding of 24-32px
- For multi-line text, maintain equal vertical spacing between lines
- Text should never overflow or touch the container edges
- Maximum width/height ratio should be 3:1 to prevent overly wide/tall designs
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background
- Text must include either:
  * Strong outline (2-3px) in contrasting color
  * Drop shadow with 30-40% opacity, 2-4px offset
- No transparent or semi-transparent text allowed
- Avoid placing light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds
- Include subtle visual container or border that follows the background shape
- Incorporate at least one tech-related visual element
- Maintain consistent sizing across all variations
- Export as vector-ready format

Background Shape Variations:
- Asymmetric blob (organic shape with 4-6 curved segments)
- Hexagon with rounded corners (corner radius 8-12px)
- Dynamic speech bubble with pointer
- Geometric burst (8-12 points with varying lengths)
- Wavy rectangle (amplitude 12-16px, 3-4 waves per side)

Color Palettes:
1. Cyber Pop
   - Primary: #FF00FF (Magenta)
   - Secondary: #00FFFF (Cyan)
   - Accent: #FFFF00 (Yellow)
   - Gradient: Primary to Secondary, 45-degree angle

   - No yellow text on cyan background

2. Forest Tech
   - Primary: #2ECC71 (Emerald)
   - Secondary: #3498DB (Blue)
   - Accent: #F1C40F (Yellow)
   - Gradient: Primary to Secondary, 60-degree angle
   - Text outline: Dark variant of Primary
   - No emerald text on blue background

3. Night Mode
   - Primary: #2C3E50 (Dark Blue)
   - Secondary: #E74C3C (Red)
   - Accent: #ECF0F1 (Light Gray)
   - Gradient: Primary to Secondary, 30-degree angle
   - Text outline: Accent color

   - No pale green text on light pink background

Technical Requirements:
- Minimum export size: 800x800px
- Vector paths must be fully closed
- No raster effects or bitmap patterns
- Text must be converted to outlines
- Maximum of 3 gradient stops per element
- Minimum stroke width: 2px
- Maximum stroke width: 4px

Layout Hierarchy:
1. Primary container shape (background)
2. Secondary decorative elements (25-30% opacity)
3. Text container/backing shape
4. Text with effects (outline/shadow)
5. Accent elements (icons, symbols)
6. Optional overlay patterns (15-20% opacity)

Style Unification Rules:
- Consistent corner radius across all elements (8px or 12px)
- Matching stroke weights within each design
- Uniform padding ratios (text-to-container: 1:4)
- Consistent shadow angles (45 degrees) and offsets (4px)
