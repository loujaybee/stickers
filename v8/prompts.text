Context: These prompts are for generating sticker designs for an AI engineering conference. Each sticker should be a unique combination of copy, style, and color palette while maintaining a maximalist Lisa Frank meets vaporwave aesthetic.

IMPORTANT: The sticker copy/text below is FINAL and must NEVER be modified, reworded, or changed in any way. Only the visual styling should be iterated on.

Sticker Copy (Core Messages):
1. "Unlocking vibe coding at enterprises"
2. "Vibe code with Cursor at work"
3. "Pair programming with my AI bestie"
4. "I sip coffee whilst Cursor codes"
5. "Cursor cooks while I chill"
