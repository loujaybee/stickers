Context: These prompts are for generating sticker designs for an AI engineering conference. Each sticker should be a unique combination of copy, style, color palette, and imagery while maintaining a cohesive tech-meets-fun theme.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The sticker copy/text below is FINAL and must NEVER be modified, reworded, or changed in any way. Only the visual styling should be iterated on.
- Each sticker should have a unique combination of message, style, shape, color palette, and imagery.
- Images should complement the text without overpowering it.
- All imagery should maintain the retro aesthetic.

Sticker Copy (Core Messages):
1. "Unlocking vibe coding at enterprises"
2. "Vibe coding at enterprises"

2. Alignment and Spacing:
   - Text MUST be perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically
   - Text must stay within shape boundaries with 24-32px padding
   - For multi-line text, maintain equal vertical spacing between lines
