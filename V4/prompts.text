Context: These prompts are for generating sticker designs for an AI engineering conference. Each sticker should be a unique combination of copy, style, and color palette while maintaining a cohesive tech-meets-fun theme.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The sticker copy/text below is FINAL and must NEVER be modified, reworded, or changed in any way. Only the visual styling should be iterated on.
- Stickers marked as "APPROVED" in the HTML comments must be preserved exactly as they are and not regenerated.

Sticker Copy (Core Messages):
1. "Unlocking vibe coding at enterprises"
