"Create text in a retro 70s style with stacked 3D letter effects. The letters should be chunky, rounded, and bubble-like, rendered in cream/off-white as the main color. Each letter should have multiple layers stacked behind it creating a 3D shadow effect, with the layers colored in a palette of coral red, mint green, and light turquoise. The shadows should extend downward and slightly to the right, creating depth. The text should appear to be inflated and soft, with rounded corners and edges, similar to balloon lettering. Each layer of the shadow should be distinct and visible, creating a stair-step effect in the 3D layers. The overall aesthetic should feel playful and retro, reminiscent of 1970s typography."
