Context: These prompts are for generating sticker designs for an AI engineering conference. The stickers should be fun and playful, incorporating popular memes and inside jokes from the AI and developer tooling communities. Think "It's Training Time!", "Gradient Descent Into Madness", or "Will Debug for Tokens" - keeping the tech theme but with a humorous twist.

Sticker Copy Ideas (Final):

1. "Vibe code with Cursor at work"
2. "Vibe coding at enterprises" 
3. "Unlocking vibe coding at enterprise"
4. "Go YOLO mode at work"
5. "I sip coffee whilst Cursor codes"
6. "Cursor cooks while I chill"
7. "Pair programming with my AI bestie"

Style Prompts:

"Create text in comic book action style with a starburst background. Letters should be bold and dynamic, with an explosion-like outline, drawn in bright primary colors. Add speed lines or motion marks radiating outward, similar to a 'POW!' or 'WHAM!' effect from vintage comics."
"Design text in a flowing, 1970s psychedelic style. Letters should curve and flow into each other with a groovy rhythm. Use warm colors like orange and pink, with letterforms that seem to dance across the space. Add small flower elements as decorative touches."
"Render text in a bubbly, cartoon pop style. Each letter should be rounded and inflated like a balloon, with a glossy highlight. Use bright, candy-like colors with a white outline and a subtle drop shadow for depth."
"Create text in a retro diner aesthetic. Letters should be chunky and chrome-like, with a metallic gradient effect. Add a thin pinstripe outline and maybe small stars or sparkles for extra pop."
"Design text as graffiti-inspired street art. Letters should have a wild, energetic style with overlapping elements and sharp angles. Include drips, arrows, or other urban art elements, using bold contrasting colors."
"Make text in a kawaii cute style with soft, rounded edges. Add small decorative elements like hearts, stars, or flowers. Use pastel colors with white highlights and gentle shadows for a friendly, approachable feel."
"Create text in an 80s Memphis style with geometric shapes in the background. Use bold patterns, squiggles, and dots. Colors should be bright and contrasting, with elements of black and white for punch."
"Design text with a hand-drawn marker effect. Letters should look slightly irregular and organic, with visible texture in the fills. Add speech bubble outlines or thought bubble shapes around the text."
"Render text in a neon sign style with electric colors. Add a glowing effect and maybe some flicker elements. Include a subtle outer halo in a contrasting color for that light-up feel."
"Create text in a skater/surf style with warped, wavy baselines. Letters should feel like they're in motion, maybe with speed lines or wind effects. Use bold colors with black outlines and maybe some checkerboard elements for that classic skate aesthetic."
